void setup() {

/*
Note that in this example, I've put all of 
my code inside the SETUP() function. 
How can you tell? Because the opening 
curly brace (just above) is not closed 
until after the last line of code. 
That doesn't make a lot of sense, 
but it works just fine. As with 
everything in computer programming, 
there are at least a dozen other 
ways to do it. In this case, since 
we don't need any animation, and we 
don't need any interaction with humans, 
and we aren't downloading data from 
the web, sticking everything 
inside SETUP() is OK.
